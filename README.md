# Natours

Natours is a website that is built with simple technologies. Here I practiced positioning elements with "float", using some cool animations, creating a custom radio button, and learned the SCSS preprocessor for the first time.

Made on [Jonas Schmedtmann's course](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-css-and-sass/).
